# Probabilistic Machine Learning- CS6190 
This repo is my code for UofU CS6190 Probabilistic Machine Learning.

## Install

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/Terry071896/probml_cs6190.git
cd probml_cs6190
conda env create -f environment.yml # creates a conda environment probml
conda activate probml # activates the environment
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=probml # installs the kernal probml for the ipynb files
```

## Homeworks
Each of the homeworks code will be under the `hw` directory in both `hw/notebooks` and `hw/scripts` and images created will be under the `imgs/hw[homework number]` directory.  It should be noted that the homework code was created and ran from the ipynb file and the py file was exported from the notebook.
